# Techy Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the **minimal-mistakes** theme. It showcases my skills, education, and professional experience as a DevOps Engineer.

## Building and Serving Locally

Follow these steps to preview the site on your machine:

1. Install Ruby and the Bundler gem.
2. Run `bundle install` to install the required gems.
3. Start a local server with `bundle exec jekyll serve` and visit the provided URL in your browser.

## Customizing Navigation

Navigation links are configured in `_config.yml` under the `nav_links` section. Edit this list to add, remove, or reorder menu items.

## Adding Content

All content pages are stored in the `_pages` directory. Create or edit Markdown files there to update the site.
